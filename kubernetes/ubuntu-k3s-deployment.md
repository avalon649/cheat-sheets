### Install Master

bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --disable traefik --disable=servicelb --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 --node-name K3S-Server --bind-address 10.0.21.130 --kube-controller-manager-arg bind-address=0.0.0.0 --kube-proxy-arg metrics-bind-address=0.0.0.0 --kube-scheduler-arg bind-address=0.0.0.0 --etcd-expose-metrics true --kubelet-arg containerd=/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock


bash
--tls-san lb-ip


### Install Worker

Grab token from the master node to be able to add worked nodes to it: 

bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token


Install k3s on the worker node and add it to our cluster:

bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_NODE_NAME=k3s-worker-01 K3S_URL=https://<IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<TOKEN> sh - 


### Kubeconfig

Kubernetes configuration file can be found under 

bash
cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yml


### Uninstall k3s

If you installed K3s with the help of the install.sh script, an uninstall script is generated during installation. The script is created on your node at 

(master)

bash 
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
 

(node)

bash
/usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh
 

### Additional information

You can change the settings of k3s by changing the service settings e.g. with 

bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service


Make sure to restart the service afterwards: 

bash
systemctl restart k3s


In many cases you can just run the installer with different variables again and it will configure your cluster accordingly without deleting it in the first place.
