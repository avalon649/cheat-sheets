### Basic Options In Tcpdump

`Tcpdump command can be used to filter all different packets.`

`tcpdump command examples`

```bash
    tcpdump -i any Capture from all interfaces
    tcpdump -i eth0 Capture from specific interface ( Ex Eth0)
    tcpdump -i eth0 -c 10 Capture first 10 packets and exit
    tcpdump -D Show available interfaces
    tcpdump -i eth0 -A Print in ASCII
    tcpdump -i eth0 -w tcpdump.txt To save capture to a file
    tcpdump -r tcpdump.txt Read and analyze saved capture file
    tcpdump -n -i eth0 Do not resolve host names
    tcpdump -nn -i eth0 Stop Domain name translation and lookups
    tcpdump -i eth0 -c 10 -w tcpdump.pcap tcp Capture TCP packets only
    tcpdump -i eth0 port 80 Capture traffic from a defined port only
    tcpdump host 192.168.1.100 Capture packets from specific host
    tcpdump net 10.1.1.0/16 Capture files from network subnet
    tcpdump src 10.1.1.100 Capture from a specific source address
    tcpdump dst 10.1.1.100 Capture from a specific destination address
    tcpdump port 80 Filter traffic based on a port
    tcpdump portrange 21-125 Filter based on port range
    tcpdump IPV6 Show only IPV6 packets
    tcpdump -nXxei 
```

### Advanced Logical Operators in Tcpdump

`We can get more advanced tcpdump command examples from here.`

```bash
    tcpdump -n src 192.168.1.1 and dst port 21 Combine filtering options
    tcpdump dst 10.1.1.1 or !icmp Either of the condition can match
    tcpdump dst 10.1.1.1 and not icmp Negation of the condition
    tcpdump <32 Shows packets size less than 32
    tcpdump >=32 Shows packets size greater than 32
```
 

`Tcpdump provides several options that enhance or modify its output. The following are the cheat sheet for tcpdump command.
Option 	Description`

```bash
-i 	Listen on the specified interface.
-n 	Don’t resolve hostnames. You can use -nn to don’t resolve hostnames or port names.
-t 	Print human-readable timestamp on each dump line, -tttt: Give maximally human-readable timestamp output.
-X 	Show the packet’s contents in both hex and ascii.
-v, -vv, -vvv 	enables verbose logging/details (which among other things will give us a running total on how many packets are captured
-c N 	Only get N number of packets and then stop.
-s 	Define the snaplength (size) of the capture in bytes. Use -s0 to get everything, unless you are intentionally capturing less.
-S 	Print absolute sequence numbers.
-q 	Show less protocol information.
-w 	Write the raw packets to file
-C file_size(M) 	tells tcpdump to store up to x MB of packet data per file.
-G rotate_seconds
