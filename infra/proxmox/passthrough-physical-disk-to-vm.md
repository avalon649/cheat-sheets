- Attach Pass Through Disk 
- Identify Disk 

Before adding a physical disk to host make note of vendor, serial  so that you'll know which disk to share in /dev/disk/by-id/ 

bash
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id | grep Z1F41BLC


- List disk by-id with lsblk 

The lsblk is pre-installed, you can print and map the serial and WWN identifiers of attached disks using the following two commands:

bash
 lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL,WWN
 ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/



- Update Configuration

bash
qm set 592 -scsi2 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3000DM001-1CH166_Z1F41BLC

update VM 592: -scsi2 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3000DM001-1CH166_Z1F41BLC


- Hot-Unplug/Remove virtual disk 

bash
qm unlink 592 --idlist scsi2

update VM 592: -delete scsi2


- Check Configuration File 

bash
grep Z1F41BLC /etc/pve/qemu-server/592.conf

scsi2: /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3000DM001-1CH166_Z1F41BLC,size=2930266584K


- Stop and Restart KVM Virtual Machine
